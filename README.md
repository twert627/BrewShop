About the project
=====
There have been various homebrew appstores throughout the years, however none of them quite fit the expectations I wished for. I decided to create one of my own, built to last with a fully featured [package manager](https://github.com/twert627/xbrew), multiple console support, elegance, and the last place you'll ever need to look for homebrew again.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on enjoying the homebrew, not the hassle of scouring the web only to find dead links, or it doesn't work
* You shouldn't go expecting quality homebrew and all you find is commercial games and outdated homebrew.
* The appstore shouldn't be complicated, simple to use - and just works.
* It should look good, too many homebrew app stores are just html lists or use a bland css library: Brewshop is built from the ground up, and has been remade several times to ensure it's on par with community standards
